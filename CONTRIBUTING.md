## Inbound license grant and DCO

This project's outbound license is CC-BY-NC-ND-4.0. Contributions are accepted inbound under a broader grant via the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO). Both pieces are required because CC-BY-NC-ND-4.0 alone cannot cleanly accept third-party derivatives.

### Required grant

By submitting a contribution to this repository, you certify that you have the right to do so under the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) 1.1, and you grant TMHSDigital a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable license to use, reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute your contribution under the project's current license (CC-BY-NC-ND-4.0) or any successor license chosen by the project.

### DCO sign-off

Every commit in a pull request must carry a `Signed-off-by:` trailer matching the commit author. Sign at commit time with the `-s` flag:

```bash
git commit -s -m "feat: add new skill"
```

This appends a line like `Signed-off-by: Jane Developer <jane@example.com>` to the commit message. The GitHub DCO App enforces this on every PR.

For the full inbound/outbound model and rationale, see [`standards/licensing.md`](https://github.com/TMHSDigital/Developer-Tools-Directory/blob/main/standards/licensing.md) in the Developer-Tools-Directory meta-repo.
